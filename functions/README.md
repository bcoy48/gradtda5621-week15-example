#### **Biomedical Named Entity Recognition**  
Now we'll use basic natural language processing capabilities to identify disease and chemical entities via a pre-trained biomedical model available via [scispaCy](https://allenai.github.io/scispacy/). In this case, we're only interested in specific entities and only if the entities are attributed to the patient (aka., ignore negated terms [e.g., 'not arthritis']). The results of the named entity recognition (aka., NER) pipeline can be displayed, written out as an annotation (e.g., for a classification model), and/or stored for further processing.
