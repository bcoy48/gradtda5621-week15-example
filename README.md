## **GRADTDA 5621 - Week 15 Synchronous Class**

### **Overview**  
There are several ways to obtain or generate data, structured (e.g., a table or document) and unstructured (e.g., web scraping or raw text). In this case we will obtain annotated text data from a GitHub repository. The idea is to demonstrate how to clone a repository in an environment (Colab) and then work through the repository's natural tree-based structure. The output of this exercise will be an application which identifies drug strings (aka., chemical entities) in synthetic clinician notes and then searches RxNorm (National Library of Medicine) via sequential API calls to obtain the drug's properties.  

### **Demonstrated concepts**  
* Github (e.g., repository clone)  
* Natural Language Processing (e.g., Named Entity Recognition)
* HTTP API (e.g., RxNav)
